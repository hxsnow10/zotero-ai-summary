You are given multiple summaries of research paper "{title}", each corresponding to a different chunk of a larger text. 
Your task is to synthesize these summaries into a single, cohesive overview of the entire paper.

Individual chunk summaries:
--- START OF CHUNK SUMMARIES ---
{text}
--- END OF CHUNK SUMMARIES ---


Guidelines:
- Avoid duplicating information found in multiple chunk summaries.
- Use neutral, concise language.
- Do not invent new details not found in the chunk summaries.
- Output format uses standard Markdown, paying attention to indentation (4 spaces).
- 组织结构跟原文章保持一致
- 如果原文为英文，记得在每一段非outline的英文后边跟一段中文翻译，除了翻译外不需要其他文字
